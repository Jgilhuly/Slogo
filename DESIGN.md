###Introduction (Kei)
**This section describes the problem your team is trying to solve by writing this program, the primary design goals of the project (i.e., where is it most flexible), and the primary architecture of the design (i.e., what is closed and what is open). It should be approximately 200-300 words long and discuss the program at a high-level (i.e., without referencing specific classes, data structures, or code).**

Our team is trying to implement an abstract engine that is able to simulate a simple Logo program. This engine consists of a GUI that gives users a variety of options on how to control the turtle on the screen, and allows the user to input commands given a certain syntax. These commands are not only limited to those that affect the turtle on the screen, but can also calculate different things. The primary design goals of this project is to separate the front-end (the GUI) and the back-end (the model) so that group members can work on these parts separately without affecting each other's code. We will also design the project in such a way that it is easy to implement new features, such as new commands, new turtles, etc. As stated, modification of the back-end from the front-end side will be closed, and vice versa. Each side will only know what is completely necessary, and all other processes are hidden. This makes extensions easier - if we were to change the front-end to some other type of display, this should be rather easy since the back-end would not be affected (open for extension, closed for modification). We intend to implement the above in a scalable manner that conforms to standard design conventions separating the program into reasonable structures using various classes. We will be using Java8 and JavaFX to do so.

###Overview (Kei)
**This section serves as a map of your design for other programmers to gain a general understanding of how and why the program was divided up, and how the individual parts work together to provide the desired functionality. As such, it should describe specific components you intend to create, their purpose with regards to the program's functionality, and how they collaborate with each other, focusing specifically on each class's behavior, not its state. It should also include a picture of how the components are related (these pictures can be hand drawn and scanned in, created with a standard drawing program, or screen shots from a UML design program). This section should be approximately 700-1000 words long and discuss specific classes, methods, and data structures, but not individual lines of code.**

The class that will jump start the entire program is the Main class. This is quite standard for any Java program - it will have a start method that is called by a main method. This main class will call the Controller class. Before we get into the details of these classes, I will explain our approach for this project. We are using two design patterns from oodesign.com - Model View Controller (MVC)  Pattern and Observer-Observable Pattern. We felt that these two patterns were appropriate for our project since we do have a model (back-end) and a view (front-end). The controller can send commands to the model to update the model's state and also can send commands to the view to update the view. For this project, we are primarily using the MVC Pattern to funnel information from the front-end to the back-end, since the user will interact with the GUI and that has to be reflected in the back-end. The Controller also has access to the Parser, which takes in some string of commands and returns a Command object, which are categorized into different subclasses, which may have more subclasses. For the moment, we are thinking of having a class for 'Move' commands, 'Math' commands, etc. 

In terms of the Observer-Observable Pattern, the Observer will be the View (SceneUpdater) and the Observable will be the TurtleModel (the model that contains the virtual turtle). To do this, the SceneUpdater will implement Java's Observer class (or we may create our own, depending on what we need to pass). This class will have an update method that will be called once the Observable has a change. In the Observable side, the TurtleModel class implements Java's Observable class. This class will then use the method 'notifyObserver(....)' to pass in some parameter or information to the Observer. The Observer will then take in this information via the 'update(Observable obj, Object args)' method. This pattern serves as a way for the back-end to pass information to the front-end without having to instantiate a front-end object in the back-end and vice versa. Of course, the Controller class will instantiate both the SceneUpdater and TurtleModel classes, and, using the method addObserver, will attach the Observer to the Observable. 

For the front-end specifics, the SceneUpdater will control the GUI class. We plan for this class to contain the important GUI elements such as buttons, TurtleView, Nodes, Menu, Canvas, etc. We are going to use this class to store these elements and give SceneUpdater the control to edit these objects (such as draw a line, change color, change images, change background, etc). This way, the GUI class will not be a mess of methods creating these JavaFX objects as well as editing them.  The GUI class will also have access to the turtle's image. Given the information passed from the back-end via the Observer-Observable pattern, we will move this image accordingly. This will be put in a class called TurtleView, which contains the image, the color, the usage of the pen, invisibility, and other methods that allows these variables to be retrieved/modified. We are also planning to have a class for the HTML page, which we have not fully discussed yet. For now, the order of action is as follows: the GUI takes in the command, the command is passed to the controller who gets back a command object from the parser, this command object is passed to the back-end, the back-end notifies the observer that a change had been made after the virtual turtle had been moved or other operations had been done, and the GUI takes this information from the SceneUpdater to display it. 

For the back-end, currently we have the TurtleModel class, which could possibly contain the x and y coordinates of the turtle and the direction its facing. We could also have other characteristics of this turtle in this class, such as the speed of its movement. This class will also have a getLocation() method, which, as the name suggests, returns the location, most likely using a Pair class (a class that we will make which contains the coordinates x and y). Although we have not discussed the specifics for the back-end classes, some ideas include creating a data structure to keep track of the commands that were passed in, a data structure to keep the variables created, a data structure to keep the turtles for potential multiple turtles for the extension, and using a timeline to frame actions for 'move' commands. For the last idea, Forward 50 would mean the action Forward 1 repeats 50 times, which would allow the turtle to move easily in 'real-time'.

###User Interface
**This section describes how the user will interact with your program (keep it simple to start). It should describe the overall appearance of program's user interface components and how users interact with these components (especially those specific to your program, i.e., means of input other than menus or toolbars). It should also include one or more pictures of the user interface (these pictures can be hand drawn and scanned in, created with a standard drawing program, or screen shots from a dummy program that serves as a exemplar). Finally, it should describe any erroneous situations that are reported to the user (i.e., bad input data, empty data, etc.). This section may be as long as it needs to be and go into as much detail as necessary to cover all your team wants to say.**

The user interface would contain a menu bar (to contain personalization of the pen, turtle, background color, access to a help page), a text input area (for commands), a console for return values, a sidebar to see previous commands, and the physical canvas/grid. The menu bar will also be used to incorporate additional requirements in the next sprint. The text input area will support commands in a number of different languages, using resource bundles. Lastly, the user will be able to select previous commands in order to run them again.

###Design Details 
**This section describes each component introduced in the Overview in detail (as well as any other sub-components that may be needed but are not significant to include in a high-level description of the program). It should describe how each component handles specific features given in the assignment specification, what resources it might use, how it collaborates with other components, and how each could be extended to include additional requirements (from the assignment specification or discussed by your team). Finally, justify the decision to create each component with respect to the design's key goals, principles, and abstractions. This section may be as long as it needs to be and go into as much detail as necessary to cover all your team wants to say.**

The relationship between the view and the controller would be one way, any commands, or anything that needed to be passed to be interpreted would go to the controller that would then parse the commands and get the appropriate command class or update the appropriate turtle, etc. Any updates to the back end turtle classes would be observed by the view updater that would update instantly. This way, the model could relay information back to the view in this way. This way, the model needs to contain an observer instance of the view updater.

The *model* would contain a general command super class and have sub command types so that each command could be generalized into a group, whether it is a math type command, or turtle status command, or a move command, and within those subgroups, and each command would have its own class, but extend these super classes. 
The *command parser* would return a specific command object and the controller would determine what type of subcommand that command belonged to, and if it was a view type command, the controller would call on the view to perform the specified command, and if it was a non-view related command, it would call the model classes to reflect that command change.

On the front end side, the three main classes are SceneUpdater, TurtleView and GUI. The SceneUpdater will handle any logic or computation that needs to be done by the front end, for example loading an image file for a new turtle image. Additionally it will handle any updates to the GUI. This class will listen to the TurleModel class, and use any changes to that class in order to update the view. The GUI is simply a collection of Nodes, including a canvas, a text input, a menu bar, and a panel of previous commands. This class will be updated by SceneUpdater. Lastly, the TurtleView will act as a container for various visual attributes of the turtle. These include the image file of the Turtle, the color of the Turtle's pen, etc. None of these classes will directly contact the backend, and only the SceneUpdater will interact with the Controller.

###API Example code (this is especially important in helping others understand how to use your API)
**It should be clear from this code which objects are responsible for completing each part of the task, but you do not have to implement the called functions. Show actual "sequence of code" that implements the following use case:  The user types 'fd 50' in the command window, and sees the turtle move in the display window leaving a trail.**
**Note, clearly show the flow of calls to public methods needed to complete this example, indicating which class contains each method called. It is not necessary to understand exactly how parsing works in order to complete this example, just what the result of parsing the command will be.**
 The commands would be typed directly into the text console 
 - if user typed in 'PENDOWN', this command would go through the command parser, and it would see if it is a subtype of a view command and either call the scene updater directly to change the value of the pen status and have the view display the return value
 - if the user typed in 'fd 50' this command would be passed to the controller and then it would give it to the command parser to then do the appropriate move methods

###Design Considerations 
**This section describes any issues which need to be addressed or resolved before attempting to devise a complete design solution. It should include any design decisions that the group discussed at length (include pros and cons from all sides of the discussion) as well as any ambiguities, assumptions, or dependencies regarding the program that impact the overall design. This section may be as long as it needs to be and go into as much detail as necessary to cover all your team wants to say.**

We talked about having a turtle view and a turtle model, where the turtle view is the image and any pen drawing methods, and the turtle model contains the x and y locations and store the heading. 
We considered where the responsability of storing the offset grid view where the back end will send original locations and final locations and the view will store things like if the pen is up/down to interpret whether or not to draw the line. We also considered where the command parser should live / be stored either between the controller and the model, and act as the other middle man between the view and the data.
We disliked the idea of having the view contain a method in the controller, but then couldn't come to a medium between using an observable and having the controller shuttle information back and forth. 
A huge consideration we had was how exactly to use the obeservable in our turtle classes because we ran into complications with the physical drawing of a line which requires a starting and ending point. If you used the observable, the view turtle would need to have the old position, but once the model turtle was changed, the view turtle would have no idea where it used to be. 
We decided to not use the observable and just have the back end turtle send information about where a line needs to be drawn/ where a turtle needs to be moved so that given original positions and new positions. This way, the front end turtle does not need to store its location, but just know have a move method, and based on if the pen is up or not, it will draw a line. <-- we are not sure about the best way mediate between these options.
If we made commmands classes, there was also a problem where it needed to be able to modify the turtle directly, but the command class couldn't have an instance of the turtle so then what is even the purpose of the separate command class? We have to consider the actual implementation of the command class further.
