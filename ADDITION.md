Addition
=====

I chose to implement this additional feature: "Add a new view that allows users to see the images of all of the turtles (active or not). Clicking on an image should let the user change that turtle's image. If your team did not implement multiple turtles, then show the image of just the single turtle."



###Estimation: 
before looking at the old code:
how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
how many files will you need to add or update? Why?

I think this feature will take me 3-4 full hours of coding and figuring out some javaFX features in order to implement the view of this. I will need to update the GUI class and also create a new class that encapulates this view of multiple turtles (aka another part of the window in the view). I would estimate an adding of like 2-3 classes. I believe that one class will contain the scene, the GUI class needs to be updated to handle the view of the turtles, and maybe the turtle class to handle an active selection.

###Review: after completing the feature:
how long did it take you to complete this new feature?
did you get it completely right on the first try?
how many files did you need to add or update? Why?
Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?
was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?
what could be improved?
what would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
